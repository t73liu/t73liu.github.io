## Description

This is a GatsbyJS starter that I built in order to replace my previous static
HTML site. It is an useful starting template for an engineer blog/portfolio site.

## Technologies

**GatsbyJS** is a static site generator that creates performant websites by default.
It uses React to render components and GraphQL to query various data sources at
build time. There are tons of official and third-party plugins that can be
easily plugged into your site to help fetch and transform data.

## Features

- Bulma and SASS for styling
- Blog posts and projects are written in markdown
- Prism.js for syntax highlighting
- PWA (progressive web app) support
- Optimized images
