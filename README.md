# [About Me](https://t73liu.github.io/)

This is a site for my side projects and blog. The site is built using GatsbyJS, React, and GraphQL.

If you want similar functionality for your own site, you can refer to my [GatsbyJS starter template](https://github.com/t73liu/gatsby-engineer-starter)
which is populated with dummy data.
