The aim of this post is to create a Python desktop app to automate some
repetitive tasks in PoE.

Path of Exile is an action RPG similar to Diablo. It is a very click heavy game
and there are a few activities that require thousands of clicks. The developers
recently addressed some of these issues with a quality of life update. This post
is purely educational. Scripting goes against the Terms of Service.

One activity is "six linking" an item which involves ~1500 clicks on average
while holding down the `shift` button.
